# Primefetch

Primefetch is a utility used to conduct operations regarding prime numbers. It is a way for me to learn Rust.

### Todo
- A mode which finds prime factors of a number with efficient algorithms (the sieves).
- Implement the `--file` option to read from a file and output the primes from it.
- General code cleanup and utilization of more Rust features
- Faster algorithms in General
- Make a library crate? 
- Profit?
